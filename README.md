# 📋 To-Do List

This is a task management application designed to help users create, organize, and track tasks efficiently. The platform features a user-friendly and responsive interface that works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices. With real-time updates, users can add, edit, and delete tasks without reloading the page.

## 🧑🏻‍💻 Project Technologies

- ### ReactTS
  - ReactTS combines React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, with TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript that provides static typing. Using TypeScript with React enhances code quality and maintainability by catching errors early and enabling type-checking, auto-completion, and better readability. ReactTS is ideal for larger, more complex applications, as it helps developers create scalable, well-structured code that’s easier to debug and refactor over time.
- ### Tailwind
  - Tailwind greatly facilitates styling to achieve a syntactically clean and easily maintainable final result, both for responsiveness and for complex stylings of certain UI sections. The contribution of well-organized cascading styles transforms a project that might initially take around 2 to 3 weeks to reach its MVP, reducing the time to 3 or 4 days.
- ### Vite
  - Vite is a manager that enables quick initialization with only the necessary tools, featuring a pre-built initial template ready to be used in the project from the start.
